# 🌍 Life Expectancy Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the **Life Expectancy dataset** to understand the factors that affect how long people live in different countries.

## 🔎 What I Did
- Checked missing values in the dataset.
- Calculated **mean, median, mode** of important columns.
- Compared **Developed vs Developing countries** (average life expectancy).
- Found **Top 10 countries** with the highest life expectancy.
- Checked correlation of life expectancy with other factors (GDP, schooling, adult mortality).
- 
## 📊 Key Insights
- Developed countries have higher average life expectancy.
- Schooling and GDP have a positive impact on life expectancy.
- Adult mortality has a negative impact on life expectancy.
